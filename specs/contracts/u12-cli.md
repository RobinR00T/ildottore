# u12-cli.md

Stage-2 build contract. 9-section anatomy per `docs/00 §2`. Read `AGENTS.md` + `docs/09` +
`docs/01 §3` + all upstream unit contracts before implementing. This unit is the **composition
root**: it wires concrete implementations to the `shared.protocols` interfaces and owns the
`dottore` command surface. It adds **no** attack/eval/scoring logic of its own.

## §1 Scope & ownership
- **OWNS:** `src/ildottore/cli/`: `app.py` (Typer root + `dottore`/`dott` entry), `wiring.py`
  (composition root: builds adapters, evaluators, mutators, scorer, stores, reporters, engine
  from config + injects them), `run.py`, `fingerprint.py`, `registry.py`, `describe.py`,
  `new_spec.py`, `replay.py`, `flags.py` (nmap-style flag parsing + `-T` template expansion),
  `exit_codes.py`, `render.py` (live progress + summary table). Note: `cli/lint.py` is owned by
  **u02**: this unit only mounts it as a subcommand.
- **MUST NOT touch:** `shared/`, `core/`, `adapters/`, `evaluators/`, `scoring/`, `mutators/`,
  `store/`, `reporting/`, `registry/`, `policy/`, `cli/lint.py`, any spec/suite YAML, `schemas/`.

## §2 Intended behavior
Give a red teamer who knows `nmap` a productive CLI in 5 minutes (`docs/09`): target positional,
scan-type/intensity flags, selectable specs (our "NSE"), multi-format output, sane defaults.
The CLI **resolves** config → scope → suite/spec selection → engine plan, **delegates** execution
to `u08` core, **streams** progress, **renders** the summary, and **maps** the outcome to a
scriptable exit code. Commands: `run` (default when a target is given), `fingerprint` (`-sV`),
`lint` (mounted from u02), `registry`, `describe`, `new-spec`, `replay`. The **scope/allowlist
gate is never bypassable**: not by `-A`, not by any flag (`docs/09 §5`, `docs/01 §6`).

## §3 Dependencies & interface contracts
- Depends on **all** units (W5 integration). Constructs concretes and injects them **only**
  through `shared.protocols`: `TargetAdapter, Evaluator, Mutator, RiskScorer, EvidenceStore,
  RunStore, Reporter`, and the `u08` engine facade. Consumes `shared.models.{TestRun, Finding,
  ModelFingerprint, RiskScore}` for rendering only.
- `run` calls the `u08` execution engine; `fingerprint` calls the `u09` fingerprint engine;
  `registry`/`describe`/`new-spec` call the `u02` spec registry; `replay` reads via the `u10`
  evidence/run store. The CLI holds **no** business logic beyond wiring + I/O.
- Reporters selected by `-o*` flags map to `Reporter.format ∈ {json, html, sarif, junit}`.

## §4 Known constraints: KEEP / DECIDE
- KEEP: composition root is the **only** place concretes meet interfaces; import-linter forbids
  `cli` being imported by any package and forbids core/adapters importing `cli` (`docs/01 §2`).
- KEEP: `--scope` is REQUIRED for any command that sends traffic (`run`, `fingerprint`, `-A`,
  `--quick`, `--deep`); default-deny; `--allow-endpoint`/`--unsafe-render` are audited, never
  silent. `--dry-run` resolves + validates and sends nothing.
- KEEP: exit codes `0` clean · `1` findings below `--fail-on` · `2` at/above `--fail-on` · `>2`
  operational error (`docs/09 §4`). `--fail-on` gates **confirmed** findings; `--include-needs-review`
  extends the gate to low-confidence ones.
- KEEP: `-T0..-T5` expand to concrete rate/concurrency/timeout defaults in `flags.py` (documented
  table); explicit `--rate/--concurrency/--timeout` override the template.
- DECIDE (OD-5): whether `--adaptive` is default-ON under `-sV`/`-A` or opt-in: CLI honors the
  engine default; do not hardcode.

## §5 Implementation plan (each step its own commit, green before next)
1. `app.py` + `flags.py` + `exit_codes.py`: Typer root, `-T` template table, exit-code enum,
   `--version`, `-v/-vv/-q/--no-color`. No traffic yet.
2. `wiring.py`: composition root: build stores/adapters/evaluators/mutators/scorer/reporters
   from resolved config; assemble the `u08` engine. Pure DI, unit-tested with fakes.
3. `run.py`: positional target + `-t`, `-sn/-sV/-A/--quick/--deep`, `--suite/-p/--spec/--exclude/
   --top-tests`, execution flags, `-o*`/`-oA`, `--fail-on/--include-needs-review/--compare`.
4. `render.py`: live per-spec progress line + category×severity×reproducibility summary table.
5. `fingerprint.py`, `registry.py`, `describe.py`, `new_spec.py`, `replay.py` (thin delegators).
6. `[project.scripts]` entry points `dottore`/`dott`; mount u02 `lint` subcommand.

## §6 Data/wire shapes
- No new persisted models. Emits reporter bytes to `-o*` paths (`-oA <prefix>` writes all four
  formats). `--compare` renders a target×spec matrix from multiple `TestRun`s.
- `-T` template → `{rate_rps, concurrency, timeout_s}` map lives in `flags.py` (golden-tested).
- Exit code is a pure function of `(findings, --fail-on, --include-needs-review, error_state)`
  in `exit_codes.py`: no side effects, table-tested.
- All terminal output honors the central redactor; secrets/PII never printed (`AGENTS.md §2`).

## §7 Acceptance criteria (machine-checkable)
- `pytest tests/cli -q` green; coverage ≥ 85% for `src/ildottore/cli`.
- `ruff check .` + `ruff format --check .` clean; `mypy src/ildottore/cli` clean.
- `lint-imports` green: `cli` imported by nobody; `core/adapters/evaluators/...` never import
  `cli`; concretes appear **only** in `cli/wiring.py` (import-contract assertion in `docs/07`).
- **Exit-code golden table** (`tests/cli/test_exit_codes.py`): clean→0, below-threshold→1,
  at/above→2, operational-error→>2; `--include-needs-review` flips low-confidence into the gate.
- **Scope gate is non-bypassable** (`tests/cli/test_scope_gate.py`): `run`/`fingerprint`/`-A`
  without `--scope` → exit >2 with a clear error and **zero** adapter sends (asserted via fake
  adapter call count); `--allow-endpoint` emits an audit record.
- **`-T` template golden** (`tests/cli/test_timing.py`): `-T0..-T5` expand to the documented
  rate/concurrency/timeout; explicit flags override.
- **CLI-map golden** (`tests/cli/test_flags.py`): every nmap↔dottore mapping in `docs/09 §1` is
  parseable; `docs/09 §3` cheat-sheet invocations parse without error under `--dry-run`.
- **Composition smoke** (`tests/cli/test_wiring.py`): `wiring.build()` returns an engine whose
  injected components satisfy each `shared.protocols` type; no concrete leaks past the root.
- `--dry-run` sends nothing (fake adapter send-count == 0); `-oA` writes exactly 4 report files.

**A-7 A no-send promise holds under COMBINATION (added 2026-09-22).** `--dry-run`,
`--estimate` and `-sn` send zero requests in **every** flag combination, asserted with socket,
DNS and httpx entry points patched to raise, and with a positive control proving the
instrument fires. Each alone was clean; `--dry-run -sV` printed "sent nothing" immediately
after ten live probes with a real bearer token, because the guard named one of three modes.

**A-8 Every printed number is produced by the code that does the work.** A count the CLI
prints (specs selected, requests to send, probes, budget ceilings) is computed by calling the
same planner and policy gate the run calls, and a test pins the printed figure to the **real
send count**. The dry-run printed the raw selection before both filters and promised 845
requests where the run sent 499, and understated a multi-target run by half.

**A-9 An operational failure exits 3.** Never 1 (which this tool uses for "findings below
`--fail-on`") and never 2 (at or above). That binds every exception class that can reach a
command: a malformed YAML, an adapter refusal, a tampered artifact, an unreadable scope. Each
one shipped as a 1 or a 2 at some point, because the handler tuple was written by listing the
classes somebody remembered. A test drives each failure through the CLI and asserts the code.

**A-10 A resumed run is bound to its target.** `--resume` refuses a run id whose stored run
belongs to a different target, and refuses when no run store is available to check. Unbound, it
produced a full report for an unprobed target with **zero requests sent**, in both directions:
a vulnerable target inheriting a clean bill of health and exiting 0, or a hardened one
inheriting criticals. The evidence cannot detect this (an `Attempt` carries no target); the run
store can.

**A-11 A declared ceiling binds every request the tool makes.** `--rate` and
`--budget-requests` cover fingerprint probes as well as attack traffic. Probes do not travel
through the runner, so they were bounded by neither: `--budget-requests 2 -sV` sent 30 requests
and then reported "limit 2, attempted 3", counting only the half that passed the ledger.

## §8 Out of scope / forbidden
- MUST NOT implement attack/mutation/evaluation/scoring/reporting/fingerprint logic (u05-u11,
  u13): only wire and call them. MUST NOT own `cli/lint.py` (u02) or edit any spec YAML.
- MUST NOT provide any way to bypass the scope/allowlist or the redactor (`docs/09 §5`).
- MUST NOT print or log secrets/PII, raw dangerous payloads (except audited `--unsafe-render`),
  or commit/push from a build loop (`AGENTS.md §2`).
- MUST NOT be imported by any other package (composition-root direction only).
- Not its call: adaptive-default decision (OD-5) · judge model (OD-3) · scope signing (OD-2).

## §9 Open decisions (human sign-off → rolls to 00-INDEX ledger)
- **OD-5** whether `--adaptive` defaults ON under `-sV`/`-A` or is opt-in (CLI mirrors engine
  default; propose opt-in for MVP‑1 to bound cost).
- Short alias `dott` alongside `dottore`: confirm both ship in `[project.scripts]` (propose yes).
- `--compare` matrix output format for the terminal (propose compact table; JSON via `-oJ`).
