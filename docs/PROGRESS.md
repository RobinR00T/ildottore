# PROGRESS — Il Dottore (living ledger)

The carryover ledger. Every agent session updates this so context survives even a cold start
(the method's observability/resume + "own the context" discipline). Newest on top.

## State — 2026-07-08 01:00 CEST — 🎉 MVP‑1 CODE COMPLETE

- **All 6 waves DONE. All 15 units built.** ✅ W0 `5c86bfc` · W1 `c33e7a1` · W2 `1a8dff9` ·
  W3 `8c87487` · W4 `61d24cd` · W5 `280794c`.
- **Merge gate GREEN:** full test suite passes; import-linter **4/4 contracts kept, 0 broken**;
  ruff + ruff-format clean (229 files); **mypy clean on 116 source modules**; `dottore --help`
  + all commands work; **E2E `dottore run --quick` executes the 20-spec T0 battery** against
  MockTarget and produces a valid JSON/summary report (all INCONCLUSIVE — correct for a bare
  mock with no scenario). 122 src files, 167 test files.
- **Stage‑6 finding #1 (FIXED):** `run` default `specs/` discovery found 0 specs because the
  loader only recurses into *spec packs*. Fixed data-only by adding `specs/pack.yaml` — now the
  built-in battery is discovered out of the box (20 specs).
- **Stage‑6 finding #2 (FIXED):** `dottore lint specs/` still exited 1 (u02 §7 / u14 §7 criterion)
  because the 3 shipped `specs/suites/*.yaml` were authored to the u02 §6 design sketch
  (`{id, version, spec_ids, defaults}`) instead of the enforced canonical `Suite` model
  (`suite_version` / `specs:[{spec_id}]`), which the fixture, tests, linter and registry all
  speak. Fixed data-only (u13): conformed the 3 suite files to the model (`version`→`suite_version`,
  `id`→`spec_id`, `defaults.runs`→`default_runs`, `framework_rollup`→`tags`; unmodeled MVP‑2
  `sampling`/`fail_on`/`requires_policy` kept as comments). Updated `tests/battery` (`entry["id"]`
  →`entry["spec_id"]`) and restored the u14 CI gate to `dottore lint specs/` (was `specs/attacks`
  + informational warning). `dottore lint specs/` now exits 0 (20 specs, 3 suites, 1 pack); full
  suite green. Note: `dottore lint specs/suites` alone still exits 1 by design — a bare dir with no
  `pack.yaml` loads as a loose *attack-spec* tree, so suite files fail attack-spec validation.
- **Pending / carryover:**
  - `git push` + create private repo `RobinR00T/ildottore` — **blocked on `gh auth login`** (6+
    local commits waiting). Commits are UNSIGNED (gpg-agent locked) — re-sign before public.
  - OD‑11 (ship `DL-PII-ELICIT-001`?) — still human-pending; defaulted disabled/policy-gated.
  - Stage‑6 deeper pass: run against a real model (staging key) to see real pass/fail, review a
    sample of findings + evidence; wire more mock scenarios so goldens exercise pass/fail paths.
  - MVP‑2 backlog per `docs/12` (RAG/agent depth, membership inference, embeddings, adversarial
    suffixes, SARIF polish, baseline/drift, coverage metric).

## State — 2026-07-07 20:48 CEST

- **Stage 3 Execute — 3 of 6 waves done.** ✅ W0 u00 (`5c86bfc`) · ✅ W1 u01/u02/u05/u07
  (`c33e7a1`) · ✅ W2 u03/u04/u10 (`1a8dff9`). Full suite green, mypy clean on 61 modules.
- **W3 launched** (`wq7p6q9iq`): u06 evaluators (hardened judge + pii/secret-shape/authz +
  membership) · u09 fingerprint (6 layers, capability_guess, no TestPlan per ADR-0006).
- Transient API "Overloaded" hit u03 twice in W2 — PITV loop retried to green (working as
  designed).
- **Permissions:** session set to `bypassPermissions` (settings.local.json) for unattended
  overnight run. Remaining waves W4 (engine+reporting+battery) → W5 (cli+ci) → merge gate.

## State — 2026-07-07 17:15 CEST

- **Stage 3 Execute in progress.** W0 `u00-shared-models` **DONE** (commit `5c86bfc`) — PITV
  2 iters, independently re-verified: 63 tests, 100% coverage on shared, ruff+mypy clean.
  The interface registry (models/protocols/enums/schema_export) is live and committed.
- **W1 launched** (`wou73jr5p`): u01 config/scope/policy/redactor · u02 registry/linter ·
  u05 mutators · u07 scoring — parallel PITV loops against installed u00.
- Also committed: agentic-extortion spec family (`bc4db46`).
- **Decision defaults locked** this block (OD-2/4/5/6/8/9/10/12/13/15) — see 00-INDEX ledger.
  OD-11 (PII elicitation) still human-pending.

## State — 2026-07-07 16:22 CEST

- **Stage:** 1 ✅ · 2 Specify **✅** (15 contracts + consistency gate reconciled) · 3 Execute ⬜ (starting W0).
- Repo bootstrap complete + first commit (37 files, **unsigned** — gpg-agent locked non-interactively).
- **Stage 2 done via workflow** (`wpzv95kk4`, 15 agents, ~981k tok): 14 unit contracts written +
  cross-unit consistency review. The gate caught **3 blocking issues** at the TestPlan/planner
  seam (u08↔u09) + missing schemas → **resolved by ADR-0006** (TestPlan+ModelFingerprint in
  u00; plan-builder is u08-only; Pydantic-first schemas). Non-blocking drifts fixed (Verdict
  `inconclusive_reason`, docs/01 Mutator, `dott` alias). OD-6..OD-15 rolled into the INDEX ledger
  with decisions.
- **⚠️ Only human-pending decision:** OD-11 — whether `DL-PII-ELICIT-001` ships in MVP-1.
  Defaulted **disabled/policy-gated** (legal-safe) until Daniel signs off.

### Next
- Stage 3 Execute: PITV build wave-by-wave from `00-INDEX` (W0 `u00-shared-models` first).

## State — 2026-07-07 16:08 CEST

- **Stage:** 1 Understand ✅ · 2 Specify 🟡 (INDEX + 1 of 15 contracts) · 3 Execute ⬜ (not started)
- **Nothing built yet** — repo is 100% specs/design. No `src/` code.
- **License:** MIT · **Repo:** private under `RobinR00T` (to flip public after we test).
- **⚠️ `gh` OAuth token expired** → cannot create remote or push. All work stays **local**
  until operator runs `gh auth login -h github.com`. Commits will be GPG-signed.

### Done
- Full spec package: `docs/00–12` + `REFERENCES.md` + ADRs `0001–0003` + `schemas/` + example
  specs/suites/targets + `scope.example.yaml`.
- Methodology aligned to **Zynap Specs-Driven Development** (from the internal deck):
  `AGENTS.md` (foundation), `docs/00` rewritten to the six-stage method + PITV + orchestration,
  `specs/contracts/00-INDEX.md` (15 units, dependency DAG in 6 waves, single-executor ledger,
  OD-1..5), exemplar contract `unit-06-evaluators.md`.
- Repo bootstrap started: `LICENSE` (MIT), `.gitignore`.

### Open decisions (rolled up — see 00-INDEX)
OD-1 logprobs common model (ADR-0005 pending) · OD-2 scope signing · OD-3 judge model default +
2nd judge · OD-4 evidence encryption timing · OD-5 adaptive planner default.

### Next (autonomous, per approved plan)
1. Finish repo bootstrap: `pyproject.toml`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
   `CODEOWNERS`, `git init` + first signed commit (local).
2. Complete Stage 2: generate the remaining 14 unit contracts from the INDEX.
3. Stage 3 Execute: PITV workflow wave-by-wave (W0→W5) to MVP‑1, then merge gate + Stage 6.

### Operator to-do
- `gh auth login -h github.com` (as `RobinR00T`) so the conductor can create the private repo
  and push the local history.
